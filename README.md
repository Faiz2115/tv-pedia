In The Home Page I have added 2 section's one is the hero section and other is the Tv Show section whose Data is being fetched from the link:"https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=all".The link which was provided by you. From the API i am displaying the name,rating,image & genres and by clicking the button, summary and some other information can be seen as well.

   In the Details Page of the individual TV Shows , i have displayed the details regarding the TV Show & to book the TV Show Slot i have provided a button which redirects to the book show page.

   Then In the Booking Page there is a form which takes basic information of the user like: Name,Email & Phone Number. I have stored the User Info in the localStorage . Which can be seen when user submits the form, his/her Details are seen in the Card.

   There is Also a All Shows Page,which can be accessed by clicking in the navbar, in this page i am calling the API to display all the TV Shows. There Details can also be accessed by clicking the Details Button.
